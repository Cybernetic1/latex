  abstract      = {In the history of the quest for human-level artificial intelligence, a number of rival paradigms have vied for supremacy. Symbolic artificial intelligence was dominant for much of the 20th century, but currently a connectionist paradigm is in the ascendant, namely machine learning with deep neural networks. However, both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, and a significant challenge for the field today is to effect a reconciliation. A central tenet of the symbolic paradigm is that intelligence results from the manipulation of abstract compositional representations whose elements stand for objects and relations. If this is correct, then a key objective for deep learning is to develop architectures capable of discovering objects and relations in raw data, and learning how to represent them in ways that are useful for downstream processing. This short review highlights recent progress in this direction.},

  abstract   = {A novel approximation method is presented for approximating the value function and selecting good actions for Markov decision processes with large state and action spaces. The method approximates state-action values as negative free energies in an undirected graphical model called a product of experts. The model parameters can be learned efficiently because values and derivatives can be efficiently computed for a product of experts. Actions can be found even in large factored action spaces by the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Simulation results show that the product of experts approximation can be used to solve large problems. In one simulation it is used to find actions in action spaces of size 240.},

  abstract  = {With the reinvigoration of neural networks in the 2000s, deep learning has become an extremely active area of research, one thats paving the way for modern machine learning. In this practical book, author Nikhil Buduma provides examples and clear explanations to guide you through major concepts of this complicated field. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are actively growing in-house deep-learning teams. For the rest of us, however, deep learning is still a pretty complex and difficult subject to grasp. If youre familiar with Python, and have a background in calculus, along with a basic understanding of machine learning, this book will get you started. Examine the foundations of machine learning and neural networks Learn how to train feed-forward neural networks Use Tensor Flow to implement your first neural network Manage problems that arise as you begin to make networks deeper Build neural networks that analyze complex images Perform effective dimensionality reduction using autoencoders Dive deep into sequence analysis to examine language Understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning},
